# CLASSIFICATION-MODEL-FOR-BANK-MARKETING-DATA-SET

In this project, we have been provided a secondary dataset given -“BANK MARKETING DATA SET” obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
It is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

We have built three classifiers for this data set: a decision tree, a naïve Bayes classifier, and a random forest and done a comparative study of their performances using F-score as the primary evaluation metric since the dataset is highly skewed.
